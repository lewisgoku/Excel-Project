### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer critical questions, such as:
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis
Include some exciting code/features worked with
```SQL
Select * from table
wHERE ID = 3,

```Microsoft Excel
Customer Name =XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$B$1:$B$1001,,0)
```

```Microsoft Excel
-  Customer Name = XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$B$1:$B$1001,,0)
-  Email = IF(XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C1:$C1001,,0)=0,"",XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$C1:$C1001,,0))
Country = XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$G$1:$G$1001,,0)
Coffee Type = INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!J$1,products!$A$1:$G$1,0))
Roast Type =
Size = 
Unit price = 
Sales = E2*L2
Coffee Type Name = IF(I2="Rob","Robusta",IF(I2="Exc","Excelsa",IF(I2="Ara","Arabica",IF(I2="Lib","Liberica",""))))
Roast Type Name = IF(J2="M","Medium",IF(J2="L","Light",IF(J2="D","Dark","")))
Loyalty Card = XLOOKUP([@[Customer ID]],customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$I$1:$I$1001,,0)
```

### Results and Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
